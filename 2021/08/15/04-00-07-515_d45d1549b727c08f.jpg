The bill would give developers the right to tell their customers about lower prices outside the app stores (without fear of punishment), and permit alternative payment mechanisms, sideloading and third-party app stores where developers could avoid platform fees.

TikTok went a bit further to restrict push notifications after &#8220;bedtime&#8221; hours for its teen users, while YouTube chose to turn on its &#8220;take a break&#8221; and &#8220;bedtime&#8221; reminders by default instead.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2188841\" style=\"width: 324px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2188841\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2188841\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png?w=314\" alt=\"\" width=\"314\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png 750w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png?resize=69,150 69w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png?resize=139,300 139w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png?resize=314,680 314w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2188841\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> TikTok<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The changes follow similar moves announced <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/27\/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact\/\">just weeks ago by Instagram<\/a>, and follow increased pressure from the U.S. Congress to do more to protect younger users from the harmful impacts of using technology.<\/p>\n<p>One piece of legislation, which tech companies may be trying to get ahead of, is an update to COPPA that would expand some protections to children under the age of 18, instead of just under 13.

You and one other player will split the pair, with one person taking the left AirPod and the other taking the right, to start the audio challenge. The players will hear different sides of the audio adventure story at the same time, which they can then play out together. Storylines may have you playing as secret agents, ghost hunters, robots and more. The game is family-friendly and can be played with kids as young as 7, though arguably some adults will have fun with this one, too.

roundup: Alibaba&#8217;s sexual assault scandal and more delayed IPOs"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><em>Hello and welcome back to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/china-roundup\/\">TechCrunch\u2019s China roundup<\/a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.<\/em><\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A sexual assault case at Alibaba has sparked a new round of #MeToo reckoning in China. Industry observers believe this is a watershed moment for the fight against China&#8217;s allegedly misogynist tech industry. Meanwhile, social media operators are still undecided on how to deal with the unprecedented public uproar against the powerful internet giant.<\/p>\n<p>In other news, more Chinese tech companies have delayed plans to go public overseas after Didi&#8217;s fallout with Chinese regulators over its rushed IPO, including Tencent&#8217;s music streaming empire and one of China&#8217;s highest-valued autonomous driving startups.<\/p>\n<h2>Call for justice<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dong_mengyu\/status\/1424023685665497093\">Just past midnight last Sunday<\/a>, an Alibaba employee posted on the company&#8217;s internal forum a detailed account saying her manager and a client had sexually assaulted her on a business trip. She took the case public after failing to obtain support from her superiors and human resources.<\/p>\n<p>The post quickly made its rounds through China&#8217;s social media platforms. People stayed up blasting Alibaba&#8217;s ignorance, toxic business drinking, and the pervasive objectification of women in the Chinese &#8220;tech industry,&#8221; which has grown so far-reaching that it&#8217;s just the contemporary corporate world.<\/p>\n<p>A day later, on August 9, Alibaba swiftly fired <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/china\/alibaba-fires-manager-who-allegedly-sexually-assaulted-female-staffer-2021-08-09\/\">the alleged perpetrator<\/a>. Two managers resigned and the firm&#8217;s head of HR was given a &#8220;disciplinary warning.&#8221; Alibaba&#8217;s CEO Daniel Zhang said he felt<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/breakingviews\/alibabas-metoo-scandal-is-warning-china-tech-2021-08-09\/\"> &#8220;shocked, angry and ashamed&#8221;<\/a> about the incident and called on the company to work with the police to investigate the case.<\/p>\n<p>This is arguably the most high-profile #MeToo case embroiling a major Chinese tech company by far and one that seems to have beckoned the toughest response from the company involved. Alibaba is<a href=\"https:\/\/weibo.com\/1897953162\/Kt9fs88Hp?from=page_1006061897953162_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime&amp;type=comment#_rnd1628785674062\">\u00a0formulating company policies<\/a> to prevent sexual assaults, which surprises many that the global tech behemoth didn&#8217;t already have those in place.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The case managed to garner widespread public attention in China thanks to social media. Within the first few hours, it seemed as though discussion around the incident was <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ritacyliao\/status\/1424084062021591044?s=20\">propagating organically and uncensored on microblogging platform Weibo<\/a>, in which Alibaba owns a majority stake.<\/p>\n<p>But people soon noticed that despite the severity of the event, it took days before the case climbed to the top of Weibo&#8217;s trending chart, a bellwether for the most talked about topic on the Chinese internet. The perceived delay recalls Weibo&#8217;s censorship of an extramarital affair involving Alibaba executive Jiang Fan last year.<\/p>\n<p>Talang Qingnian, roughly &#8220;Surfing Youth,&#8221; a social media column under state paper People&#8217;s Daily, blasted in an article:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The slow buildup of discussion again raised suspicion over whether Alibaba has manipulated public discourse.<\/p>\n<p>Ever since the Jiang Fan case, the country&#8217;s attitude has been very clear that capital must not control the media.<\/p>\n<p>As the basic infrastructure for truthful news in China, Weibo should not be a tool for any stakeholder to manipulate public opinion.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The article fanned up more public outrage but was soon <a href=\"https:\/\/chinadigitaltimes.net\/chinese\/669530.html?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_b84d88699d79bd960d5adbe600ea3be381a194b2-1628779835-0-gqNtZGzNAeKjcnBszQjO\">taken down<\/a>, likely because its wording was too strong. The Chinese state media apparatus is vast and only a few outlets, such as Xinhua, consistently convey top-level leaders&#8217; official opinions. It&#8217;s not uncommon to see the less authoritative state-affiliated publications back down on reports that have cause backlashes. Last week, an article from a state-affiliated economic paper removed a piece calling video games <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/07\/china-roundup-game-algorithm-crackdown\/\">&#8220;spiritual opium,&#8221;<\/a> a loaded description that had earlier tanked the stocks of Tencent and NetEase, and republished the article with a softer tone.<\/p>\n<h2>Smaller war chests<\/h2>\n<p>Regulatory uncertainties have always been flagged as a risk by Chinese companies seeking overseas listings, but it was largely up to foreign investors to decide whether they were worthwhile investments. China&#8217;s recent regulatory onslaught on its tech darlings, however, has become a real deterrent for Chinese firms&#8217; IPO dream.<\/p>\n<p>This week, reports arrived that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/09\/the-china-tech-crackdown-continues\/\">NetEase Music<\/a>, a popular music streaming service, and Pony.ai, an autonomous vehicle startup <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/06\/chinese-autonomous-vehicle-startup-pony-ai-hits-5-3-billion-valuation\/\">last valued at $5.3 billion<\/a>, have respectively postponed their plans to list in Hong Kong and New York.<\/p>\n<p>Beijing has become warier of its data-rich companies getting scrutinized by U.S. regulators. Last month, the U.S. securities regulator said Chinese companies that want to raise capital in the U.S. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/finance\/exclusive-us-regulator-freezes-chinese-company-ipos-over-risk-disclosures-2021-07-30\/\">must provide information<\/a> about their legal structure and disclose the risk of Beijing&#8217;s interference in their business.<\/p>\n<p>Many Chinese tech firms have learned from<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/20\/china-roundup-data-security-clampdown\/\"> Didi&#8217;s fallout with the government<\/a>, which had reportedly told the ride-sharing company to hold off on its listing until it sorted out a data protection framework. Didi went ahead regardless, triggering a government probe into its data practice and tanking its shares, which now stand at $8 apiece compared to $16 around its debut in early July.<\/p>\n<p>Beijing&#8217;s crackdown has affected every major player in China&#8217;s consumer tech sector,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/7e6f9a08-37be-4ab3-ae15-953533ab33b5\"> wiping as much as $87 billion off<\/a> the net worth of the country&#8217;s tech billionaires, including Pony Ma of Tencent and Colin Huang of Pinduoduo, according to Financial Times. The government wants <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/31\/china-roundup-keep-down-internet-upstarts-cultivate-hard-tech\/\">&#8220;hard tech&#8221; like semiconductors and clean energy<\/a>, so it has made it clear to future entrepreneurs where they should allocate their energy.

We interviewed him earlier this week to hear more about how he sees marketing in 2021.<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere on TechCrunch and Extra Crunch this week, we published guest columns about using influencers in early-stage brands, the global retail media spending trend and talked to Growth Folks, a growth marketing organization in India.<\/p>\n<p>But first, here are a couple of the most recent recommendations from founders in our startup growth marketer survey. (If there\u2019s a growth marketer that you\u2019ve enjoyed working with, <a href=\"https:\/\/oathtechevents.typeform.com\/to\/bwwIWF03\">please tell us here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Marketer: <\/strong>Bili Sule, <a href=\"https:\/\/algrowithm.com\/\">alGROWithm<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Recommended by: <\/strong>Femi Aiki, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.foodlocker.com.ng\">Foodlocker<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Testimonial: \u201c<\/strong>Bili has a proven track record of driving growth, as the former vice president of Growth Marketing at Jumia Nigeria and as a senior growth consultant for Founders Factory Africa.

Now, I see many startups going out of the box and putting in efforts to find new ways of acquisition. They haven\u2019t restricted them to acquiring users via the traditional ways and that\u2019s why you see so many ideas going viral so easily.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/09\/early-stage-brands-should-also-unlock-the-power-of-influencers\/?tpcc=ECTW2020\">(Extra Crunch) Early-stage brands should also unlock the power of influencers:<\/a> Jonathan Martinez, an experienced growth marketer, breaks down influencer marketing.

We got Ezra&#8217;s permission, thankfully. The mixup was a bummer as we learned a lot. In the future, we&#8217;ll not make that mistake and keep all the voices.<\/p>\n<p>So, what did we talk about? The following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/06\/crypto-biden-amendment-infrastructure-bill-proof-of-work\/\">current state of crypto regulation in America<\/a>, and how the government may screw everything up. In short, tech moves fast, and government moves slow. This creates friction.<\/li>\n<li>Coinbase <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/10\/coinbase-crushes-q2-expectations-notes-q3-trading-volume-is-trending-lower\/\">kicked the ever-loving shit out of its Q2 earnings<\/a>.

You can understand why. The company is printing cash lately, helping drive more investment into localized exchanges in different markets.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Ok, we&#8217;re back Monday with your regularly scheduled programming!<\/p>\n<div class=\"article-content\">\n<p><em>Equity drops every Monday at 7:00 a.m. PST, Wednesday, and Friday morning at 7:00 a.m. PST, so subscribe to us on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/id1215439780\">Apple Podcasts<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/overcast.fm\/itunes1215439780\/equity\">Overcast<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=rZDFHv2sQUul_g94iCRgpQ\">Spotify<\/a> and all the casts.<\/em><\/p>\n<\/d<div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>iv>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This week Danny and Alex and Chris took to Twitter Spaces to chat about the current state of the crypto economy, and hang out with friends in a live Twitter Space.

the playbook for launching a new company involved a tried-and-true list of to-dos. Once you built an awesome product with a catchy name, you\u2019d try to get a feature article on TechCrunch, a front-page hit on Hacker News, hunted on ProductHunt and an AMA on Quora.<\/p>\n<p>While all of these today remain impressive milestones, it\u2019s never been harder to corral eyeballs and hit a breakout adoption trajectory.<\/p>\n<p>In this new decade, it is possible to first out-market your competitor, and then raise lots of money, hire the best team and build, rather than the other way around (building first, then marketing).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Looks like <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stripe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@stripe<\/a> redesigned their landing page.<\/p>\n<p>How long until we see these colorful gradients on other startups&#39; landing pages?\ud83d\ude05<a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/c6DL5mEUm4\">https:\/\/t.co\/c6DL5mEUm4<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/cCh8NyXawy\">pic.twitter.com\/cCh8NyXawy<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Marc K\u00f6hlbrugge (@marckohlbrugge) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/marckohlbrugge\/status\/1280562132061491203?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 7, 2020<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>Outbound marketing tools and company newsletters are useful, but they\u2019re also a slow burn and offer low conversion in the new creator economy. So where does this leave us?<\/p>\n<p>With audiences spread out over so many platforms, reaching cult status requires some level of hacking. Brand-building is no longer a one-hit game, but an exercise in repetition: It may take four or five times for a user to see your startup\u2019s name or logo to recognize, remember or Google it.<\/p>\n<p>Below are some growth tactics that I hope will help jump-start the effort to building an engaged user base.<\/p>\n<h2>Laying the groundwork for user-generated content<\/h2>\n<p>Before users are evangelists, they are observers. Consider creating a bot to alert you of any product mentions on Twitter, or surface subject-matter discussions on Reddit (\u201cBest tools to manage AWS costs?\u201d or \u201cWhich marketplace do you resell your old electronics on?&#8221;), which you can then respond to with thoughtful commentary.<\/p>\n<p>Join relevant communities on Discord, infiltrate Slack groups of relevant conferences (including past iterations of a conference\u200a \u2014 \u200achances are those groups are still alive with activity), follow forums on StackOverflow and engage in the discussions on all these channels.<\/p>\n<p>The more often you post, the better your posts convert.

I have seen this firsthand as the founder of a tech company that serves a wide range of organizations, including amateur to collegiate and professional sports, occupational health and a growing roster of military commands.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tMany founders fail to explore DOD opportunities because they do not want to be seen as engaging in the business of war.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>During the last presidential administration, a handful of colleagues questioned whether serving the military was consistent with our mission of helping the world move better. Over the past few years, this stigma toward military work has roiled some of the largest companies in Silicon Valley, sometimes leading to contract cancelations, non-renewal pledges and a noticeable chilling effect toward work involving the United States military.<\/p>\n<p>Partnerships between technology companies and the military are nothing new, but rarely have they attracted as much controversy as they do today. These partnerships were the norm throughout the 20th century, yielding war-winning technologies &#8212; like microwave radar, GPS and ARPANET &#8212; that pulled double-duty in peacetime as the building blocks of our modern connected world.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Military contracts have been traditionally viewed in Silicon Valley as a win-win &#8212; for the nation\u2019s military superiority and for a company\u2019s bottom line. Moonshot projects backed by the federal government\u2019s financial resources also represented some of the most interesting workarounds for product-minded technologists.<\/p>\n<p>That relationship has been knocked off its bearings over the past several years, with employees at Microsoft, Google and Amazon, among other companies, seeking to distance themselves from all federal projects due to the revulsion of the previous administration&#8217;s policies. But with new leadership in Washington, companies and tech workers need to determine if the stigma against military work will become permanently ingrained or limited to one chapter in an evolving relationship.<\/p>\n<p>Before looking forward, one common misconception is worth correcting from the previous administration about the tension between employees and the military. Recent research challenges the notion that anti-military views are universal among the tech workforce.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/live-cset-georgetown.pantheonsite.io\/publication\/cool-projects-or-expanding-the-efficiency-of-the-murderous-american-war-machine\/\">survey<\/a> conducted between late 2019 and early 2020, Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology found that less than a quarter of AI professionals view Pentagon work in a negative light, and 78% consider it a positive or neutral.<\/p>\n<p>Companies that are open to pursuing opportunities with the Department of Defense should consider several advantages and differences between commercial and government clients.<\/p>\n<p>Federal contracts are generally distinguished by large dollar amounts, low profit margins and long periods of performance. This can appeal to VC-backed companies that are valued based on revenue, and the unique structure of government contracts brings a welcome complement to the lucrative but highly volatile work in B2B and B2C markets. Blending the two extremes produces a stronger whole, not unlike mutual funds that balance stocks and bonds.<\/p>\n<p>Many founders fail to explore DOD opportunities because they do not want to be seen as engaging in the business of war. We encountered a version of this at Sparta Science with colleagues who conflated our work to support federal employees with a full endorsement of all government policy.<\/p>\n<p>Reality is more nuanced. The DOD has an annual budget of more than half a trillion dollars and a workforce of 2.8 million. Only a portion of these individuals are directly engaged in warfighting, and they rely on great numbers of administrators and knowledge professionals to accomplish each mission.<\/p>\n<p>The DOD has approximately 1.3 million active contracts at any given moment, spanning fields as diverse as healthcare, apparel, logistics and software licensing. The military is rightly described as a cross-section of the United States, and supporting those who serve is a Silicon Valley tradition, good business practice and the right thing to do.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"zOhb6wfiB3\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/11\/experts-say-space-force-is-a-vital-massive-shift-for-us-military\/\">Experts say Space Force is a vital, massive shift for US military<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Experts say Space Force is a vital, massive shift for US military&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/11\/experts-say-space-force-is-a-vital-massive-shift-for-us-military\/embed\/#?secret=zOhb6wfiB3\" data-secret=\"zOhb6wfiB3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The military is rightly described as a cross-section of the United States, and supporting those who serve is a Silicon Valley tradition, good business practice and the right thing to do.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574430,"featured_media":2189868,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"60be6edb-5644-398b-95c9-ebad26197f96"},"categories":[25515,352,17396],"tags":[580168,54421,488,31632],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/GettyImages-1191026601.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3yUEYZ6","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","editorialContentProvider":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[2187757],"hide_featured_image":false,"canonical_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/14\/silicon-valley-should-fight-its-stigma-against-military-work\/","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2187758"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2187758"}],"version-history":[{"count":10,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2187758\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2189871,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2187758\/revisions\/2189871"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/phil-wagner"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2187758&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574430"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2189868"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2187758"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2187758"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2187758"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2187758"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2187758"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2187758"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2187758"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":2187757,"name":"Phil Wagner","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/phil-wagner\/","description":"<a href=\"https:\/\/spartascience.com\/drphilwagner\/\">Dr. Phil Wagner<\/a> is the founder and CEO of Sparta Science.

shows off his new wireless adaptor for his live streaming studio. The result is a captivating view of his console as he switches between closeups and incoming feed from the rest of the Gang, all captured in a widescreen cinematic view. The underlying message is that live realtime video production has become accessible to virtually anyone as streaming becomes ubiquitous at the so-called citizen level.<\/p>\n<p>Trailblazers like Brent and his CRMPlayaz partner in crime Paul Greenberg have been way out on the bleeding edge of this stuff; now we&#8217;re seeing something similar to what&#8217;s going on in the creator boom. Newsletters are becoming a baked in feature of the major social platforms, as is live audio streaming a la Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces. This week, Salesforce announced its Salesforce+ streaming network, and celebrated its completion of the Slack acquisition with several new enterprise spins on live audio (Huddles) and cross-company collaboration via Slack Connect.<\/p>\n<p>Roll this up with the first wave of work from anywhere efforts to get back to school and the office, streaming as a service may be a key feature of the ongoing hybrid approach to fighting off the pandemic. The political struggle with vaccinations and masking seems destined for the long haul. How the tech community responds should be a more hopeful sign of progress. At the professional level, Disney and Scarlett Johannson are trading lawsuit threats as month-old contracts are ripped up. Newsletter deals are chasing a dwindling population of hit authors as the New York Times puts most of their star-driven publications behind the paywall. The more things transform, the more familiar they seem.<\/p>\n<p>Even the Gang newsletter sports a link to Om Malik&#8217;s post on Nam June Paik, the experimental video pioneer. I was his TA at California Institute of the Arts, and &#8220;borrowed&#8221; his associate Abe&#8217;s 3 Sony black and white portapacks to film a Firesign Theatre writing session.

Want the weekly digest in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\">here<\/a>.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>This past week, edtech entrepreneurs, investors and analysts congregated at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.asugsvsummit.com\/\">ASU+GSV<\/a>, a yearly global edtech conference, to reflect on the sector\u2019s newfound spotlight after the massive jolt of COVID-19. Beyond masked excitement to finally meet Twitter friends in real life, signs of bullishness were everywhere.<\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/symba-named-winner-of-the-2021-gsv-cup-301354788.html\">digital-first talent development platform for interns<\/a> that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/25\/internships-are-getting-canceled-due-to-covid-19-heres-why-you-should-care\/\">once didn\u2019t have product-market fit<\/a> won the startup cup. My panels were all with newly minted startup unicorns. And everyone didn\u2019t know everyone, a feat that shows how the conference went from a niche industry meetup to a broader event for a new generation of founders.<\/p>\n<p>My takeaway from the entire week, though, was more than edtech is booming (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jomayra_herrera\/status\/1426194668937699329\">which, it is)<\/a>. Instead, I felt like the general sentiment at the conference \u2014 even with polite disagreement \u2014 was that the sector getting spotlighted means it finally has the buy-in to go everywhere.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, edtech is at a point where it doesn\u2019t need to just rely on itself to accomplish its goals. It can operate outside of a silo, which feels like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/22\/to-win-post-pandemic-edtech-needs-to-start-thinking-big\/\">the needed follow-up to the sector\u2019s 2020.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>For example, if a platform brings fun UX to instruction online but doesn\u2019t take into account how that move impacts childcare, mental health and the digital divide, the impact of its savvy solution will be immediately limited. Consolidation, which will continue to play out due to freshly minted unicorns, won\u2019t just be edtech scooping up edtech, but you may see companies begin to launch products that take into account the full human experience.<\/p>\n<p>BetterUp, a reskilling and coaching platform for employees before and beyond the C-suite, is signaling that it\u2019s already happening. The edtech company announced that it is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterup.com\/solutions\/betterup-care\">diving more into behavioral health<\/a> with new products.<\/p>\n<p>Operating beyond edtech insiders is the difference between creating products that reinforce the status quo and inventing ones that question the status quo on its head. Fiveable, a virtual space for high schoolers to study and express themselves, has turned dozens of its users into interns. The feedback loop there is brutal \u2014 high schoolers are harsh \u2014 but means that the people making decisions for them finally aren\u2019t adults talking to adults.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the lack of training wheels means that it\u2019s easier for startups to go rogue. As the pandemic unevenly plays out, remote school may become the normal once again. Companies have to be massively focused, and humble, about their reach. Reflection will be important in what distinguishes a Course Hero from a Codecademy to a Coursera \u2014 and when it makes sense to leave their own lane.<\/p>\n<p>It was a refreshing, surreal week talking to the people behind the dollars and ideas of our future educational landscape. The jolt of the pandemic highlighted the inequities and work left to be done.

The bill would give developers the right to tell their customers about lower prices outside the app stores (without fear of punishment), and permit alternative payment mechanisms, sideloading and third-party app stores where developers could avoid platform fees.

TikTok went a bit further to restrict push notifications after &#8220;bedtime&#8221; hours for its teen users, while YouTube chose to turn on its &#8220;take a break&#8221; and &#8220;bedtime&#8221; reminders by default instead.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2188841\" style=\"width: 324px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2188841\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2188841\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png?w=314\" alt=\"\" width=\"314\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png 750w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png?resize=69,150 69w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png?resize=139,300 139w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png?resize=314,680 314w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2188841\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> TikTok<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The changes follow similar moves announced <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/27\/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact\/\">just weeks ago by Instagram<\/a>, and follow increased pressure from the U.S. Congress to do more to protect younger users from the harmful impacts of using technology.<\/p>\n<p>One piece of legislation, which tech companies may be trying to get ahead of, is an update to COPPA that would expand some protections to children under the age of 18, instead of just under 13.

You and one other player will split the pair, with one person taking the left AirPod and the other taking the right, to start the audio challenge. The players will hear different sides of the audio adventure story at the same time, which they can then play out together. Storylines may have you playing as secret agents, ghost hunters, robots and more. The game is family-friendly and can be played with kids as young as 7, though arguably some adults will have fun with this one, too.

startups-and-markets newsletter. It\u2019s inspired by what the weekday <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/the-exchange\/\"><em>Exchange column<\/em><\/a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. <\/em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\"><em>here<\/em><\/a><em>.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Happy weekend, friends. I am writing to you on Friday afternoon after powering through a grilled cheese. But as I have a huge iced coffee on deck, we can dodge a food coma and get right to work. Today we\u2019re talking about a pretty neat venture round, chatting with a founder about verticalization and riffing on Marqeta\u2019s earnings report. So, we have fintech and SaaS and public company notes for your enjoyment. Let\u2019s do it!<\/p>\n<h2>HiHello\u2019s ambitious Series A<\/h2>\n<p>You may be familiar with <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ManuKumar\">Manu Kumar<\/a>. He\u2019s a venture capitalist at K9 Ventures. But he\u2019s also building a startup at the same time, and it\u2019s the latter effort that we\u2019re interested in today.<\/p>\n<p>The company, called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hihello.me\/\">HiHello<\/a>, raised <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hihello.me\/blog\/series-a-press-release\">a $7.5 million Series A<\/a>, it announced recently. Foundry led the investment, Lux Capital took part, and a host of angels also kicked in checks. So far, so ordinary. But the round is not the interesting bit of the HiHello story. Instead, it\u2019s what the company is building.<\/p>\n<p>A question: When did you last order business cards? I can\u2019t recall, frankly, but somewhere between my last job and coming back to TechCrunch I forgot to get new cards. And not simply thanks to COVID or the fact that I now live far from San Francisco. I just didn\u2019t think of it as they didn\u2019t seem too useful.<\/p>\n<p>HiHello is building something akin to the future of business cards for the internet. Per Kumar, everyone still needs a way to show their identity and introduce themselves, even in a digital world. Sure, for scheduled gatherings, he argued, you can do prep. But for meeting folks in a more unplanned manner, having a way to share your identity is useful.<\/p>\n<p>So, HiHello lets you create virtual business cards of a sort for yourself. But not just one, the idea is to have several, one for each of your personas. Kumar said that I could have one for our podcast (Equity), one for TechCrunch proper and so forth. You can make them for your personal life as well.<\/p>\n<p>I figured that business cards were dead. And that we didn\u2019t need to rebuild them. Kumar doesn\u2019t agree. He sees a future where HiHello can create what are, in effect, personal social networks around context. It\u2019s bold and it\u2019s counterintuitive. Good startup fodder, in other words.<\/p>\n<p>HiHello is monetizing off of consumer revenue today and has a business product as well. Let\u2019s see how quickly the startup can grow. It\u2019s about time we got excited about a new sort of social product.<\/p>\n<h2>Going vertical<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve written about Skyflow <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/21\/skyflow-raises-7-5m-to-build-its-privacy-api-business\/\">a few times<\/a>. It\u2019s co-founder, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/anshublog\">Anshu Sharma<\/a>, is someone I\u2019ve known for ages. We met when he was at Storm Ventures. Since then he\u2019s invested as an angel and founded a few companies, one of which is Skyflow. The software startup sells a digital vault that allows for PII and other critical information to be secured on customers\u2019 behalf and accessed in a safe manner, allowing companies for whom information security is not their core focus to avoid breaches.<\/p>\n<p>The model is working, with Skyflow raising capital at a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/08\/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data\/\">pretty aggressive rate<\/a>. And Sharma seems chuffed thus far with customer progress. (Sharma also provided notes that helped me <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/06\/venture-capital-probably-isnt-dead\/\">ground an essay the other day<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Recently Skyflow <a href=\"https:\/\/www.skyflow.com\/post\/accelerating-healthtech-innovation-introducing-the-healthcare-data-privacy-vault\">announced<\/a> a particular flavor of product for the healthcare market. Given that I\u2019ve been tracking the company since it first launched, I was curious. So I got Sharma back on the phone to explain his verticalization strategy &#8212; I was curious how he was picking markets to pursue and where he might take his company next.<\/p>\n<p>Sharma said that his company\u2019s plan is to prove its technology in complex markets, and then expand its remit over time. Hence the healthcare push and Skyflow\u2019s work with storing financial data. By solving hard problems and selling to complicated customers he said, Skyflow will earn market permission to offer its tech to other folks.<\/p>\n<p>From the CEO\u2019s perspective, we need to \u201crewire\u201d the internet from the ground up with a privacy focus. Citing a <a href=\"https:\/\/davidsnotes.substack.com\/p\/marc-andreessen-from-the-internets\">Marc Andreeseen riff<\/a> about how not building payments tech into the internet from the start was an error, Sharma argued that two things were forgotten in the early days of the web: payments, yes, <em>and<\/em> privacy.<\/p>\n<p>The verticalization strategy of Skyflow, then, is to tackle the hardest problems that it can &#8212; healthcare data is privy to all sorts of rules and regulations &#8212; and then broaden its focus until PII is safer for everyone. It\u2019s a fundamentally optimistic take on where the internet could be heading. Not a Facebookian world where privacy is theoretical and adtech is persistent, but a world where your data is yours and is safe, stored and out of reach.<\/p>\n<p>The competitive landscape that Skyflow plays in will harden. But so long as even some of the startups in the market that want to return privacy to individuals wins, I will be content.<\/p>\n<h2>Marqeta\u2019s first earnings call<\/h2>\n<p>Somewhat lost amidst the wave of IPOs that we\u2019ve seen this year <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/18\/inside-marqetas-fascinating-fintech-ipo\/\">was Marqeta\u2019s debut<\/a>, a fintech unicorn working in the card issuing space. It reported <a href=\"https:\/\/investors.marqeta.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/marqeta-second-quarter-earnings-report-shows-76-percent-jump-net\">its earnings<\/a> publicly for the first time this week, so I got on the phone with its CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jasonmatthewgardner\">Jason Gardner<\/a> to yammer about the results.<\/p>\n<p>In brief, Marqeta grew quickly in the second quarter, easily besting expectations. The company lost more money than the markets anticipated however, leading to its shares shedding effectively all their post-IPO gains.<\/p>\n<p>A few notes from the call. First, Gardner seems content to be past the public offering. He said that he\u2019s had the chance to fall back in love with running the company now that his 18-month IPO market is complete. And he said that swapping yearly board-level planning for quarterly reports has been enjoyable, as having more regular disclosures brings a sense of urgency to the company\u2019s work.<\/p>\n<p>As we usually hear private company CEOs worry about distracting earnings calls and the like, it was somewhat refreshing to hear a public executive praise floating their company. It reminded us of the comments that we heard <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/07\/whats-after-low-code-and-why-should-you-go-public\/\">from BigCommerce CEO Brent Bellm<\/a> on the same topic, even if they like being public for different reasons.<\/p>\n<p>More important to our understanding of the world of startups, however, was Marqeta\u2019s notes on the BNPL market. In the wake <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/10\/fintech-giant-klarna-raises-639m-at-a-45-6b-valuation\/\">of Klarna\u2019s rise<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/02\/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay\/\">Square buying Afterpay<\/a>\u00a0and a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/03\/what-squares-acquisition-of-afterpay-means-for-startups\/\">zillion startup BNPL rounds<\/a>, seeing Marqeta note the buy now. pay later space as a growth market for its work caught our eye. Why was BNPL helping a card issuing platform?<\/p>\n<p>Well, it turns out, the virtual cards that Marqeta and others can spin up for customers are often used as part of the software sinew that makes BNPL transactions possible. The fintech world is always more interconnected than you expect. So, when we consider BNPL as a category, we\u2019ll do well to also keep tabs on what other boats its growth may be floating. That expands the number of startups that could be riding the BNPL wave.<\/p>\n<p>One tip before we go. The fastest way to get an explanation of a market dynamic that you are not familiar with is to ask a public CEO to explain it to you.

roundup: Alibaba&#8217;s sexual assault scandal and more delayed IPOs"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><em>Hello and welcome back to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/china-roundup\/\">TechCrunch\u2019s China roundup<\/a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.<\/em><\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A sexual assault case at Alibaba has sparked a new round of #MeToo reckoning in China. Industry observers believe this is a watershed moment for the fight against China&#8217;s allegedly misogynist tech industry. Meanwhile, social media operators are still undecided on how to deal with the unprecedented public uproar against the powerful internet giant.<\/p>\n<p>In other news, more Chinese tech companies have delayed plans to go public overseas after Didi&#8217;s fallout with Chinese regulators over its rushed IPO, including Tencent&#8217;s music streaming empire and one of China&#8217;s highest-valued autonomous driving startups.<\/p>\n<h2>Call for justice<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dong_mengyu\/status\/1424023685665497093\">Just past midnight last Sunday<\/a>, an Alibaba employee posted on the company&#8217;s internal forum a detailed account saying her manager and a client had sexually assaulted her on a business trip. She took the case public after failing to obtain support from her superiors and human resources.<\/p>\n<p>The post quickly made its rounds through China&#8217;s social media platforms. People stayed up blasting Alibaba&#8217;s ignorance, toxic business drinking, and the pervasive objectification of women in the Chinese &#8220;tech industry,&#8221; which has grown so far-reaching that it&#8217;s just the contemporary corporate world.<\/p>\n<p>A day later, on August 9, Alibaba swiftly fired <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/china\/alibaba-fires-manager-who-allegedly-sexually-assaulted-female-staffer-2021-08-09\/\">the alleged perpetrator<\/a>. Two managers resigned and the firm&#8217;s head of HR was given a &#8220;disciplinary warning.&#8221; Alibaba&#8217;s CEO Daniel Zhang said he felt<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/breakingviews\/alibabas-metoo-scandal-is-warning-china-tech-2021-08-09\/\"> &#8220;shocked, angry and ashamed&#8221;<\/a> about the incident and called on the company to work with the police to investigate the case.<\/p>\n<p>This is arguably the most high-profile #MeToo case embroiling a major Chinese tech company by far and one that seems to have beckoned the toughest response from the company involved. Alibaba is<a href=\"https:\/\/weibo.com\/1897953162\/Kt9fs88Hp?from=page_1006061897953162_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime&amp;type=comment#_rnd1628785674062\">\u00a0formulating company policies<\/a> to prevent sexual assaults, which surprises many that the global tech behemoth didn&#8217;t already have those in place.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The case managed to garner widespread public attention in China thanks to social media. Within the first few hours, it seemed as though discussion around the incident was <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ritacyliao\/status\/1424084062021591044?s=20\">propagating organically and uncensored on microblogging platform Weibo<\/a>, in which Alibaba owns a majority stake.<\/p>\n<p>But people soon noticed that despite the severity of the event, it took days before the case climbed to the top of Weibo&#8217;s trending chart, a bellwether for the most talked about topic on the Chinese internet. The perceived delay recalls Weibo&#8217;s censorship of an extramarital affair involving Alibaba executive Jiang Fan last year.<\/p>\n<p>Talang Qingnian, roughly &#8220;Surfing Youth,&#8221; a social media column under state paper People&#8217;s Daily, blasted in an article:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The slow buildup of discussion again raised suspicion over whether Alibaba has manipulated public discourse.<\/p>\n<p>Ever since the Jiang Fan case, the country&#8217;s attitude has been very clear that capital must not control the media.<\/p>\n<p>As the basic infrastructure for truthful news in China, Weibo should not be a tool for any stakeholder to manipulate public opinion.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The article fanned up more public outrage but was soon <a href=\"https:\/\/chinadigitaltimes.net\/chinese\/669530.html?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_b84d88699d79bd960d5adbe600ea3be381a194b2-1628779835-0-gqNtZGzNAeKjcnBszQjO\">taken down<\/a>, likely because its wording was too strong. The Chinese state media apparatus is vast and only a few outlets, such as Xinhua, consistently convey top-level leaders&#8217; official opinions. It&#8217;s not uncommon to see the less authoritative state-affiliated publications back down on reports that have cause backlashes. Last week, an article from a state-affiliated economic paper removed a piece calling video games <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/07\/china-roundup-game-algorithm-crackdown\/\">&#8220;spiritual opium,&#8221;<\/a> a loaded description that had earlier tanked the stocks of Tencent and NetEase, and republished the article with a softer tone.<\/p>\n<h2>Smaller war chests<\/h2>\n<p>Regulatory uncertainties have always been flagged as a risk by Chinese companies seeking overseas listings, but it was largely up to foreign investors to decide whether they were worthwhile investments. China&#8217;s recent regulatory onslaught on its tech darlings, however, has become a real deterrent for Chinese firms&#8217; IPO dream.<\/p>\n<p>This week, reports arrived that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/09\/the-china-tech-crackdown-continues\/\">NetEase Music<\/a>, a popular music streaming service, and Pony.ai, an autonomous vehicle startup <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/06\/chinese-autonomous-vehicle-startup-pony-ai-hits-5-3-billion-valuation\/\">last valued at $5.3 billion<\/a>, have respectively postponed their plans to list in Hong Kong and New York.<\/p>\n<p>Beijing has become warier of its data-rich companies getting scrutinized by U.S. regulators. Last month, the U.S. securities regulator said Chinese companies that want to raise capital in the U.S. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/finance\/exclusive-us-regulator-freezes-chinese-company-ipos-over-risk-disclosures-2021-07-30\/\">must provide information<\/a> about their legal structure and disclose the risk of Beijing&#8217;s interference in their business.<\/p>\n<p>Many Chinese tech firms have learned from<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/20\/china-roundup-data-security-clampdown\/\"> Didi&#8217;s fallout with the government<\/a>, which had reportedly told the ride-sharing company to hold off on its listing until it sorted out a data protection framework. Didi went ahead regardless, triggering a government probe into its data practice and tanking its shares, which now stand at $8 apiece compared to $16 around its debut in early July.<\/p>\n<p>Beijing&#8217;s crackdown has affected every major player in China&#8217;s consumer tech sector,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/7e6f9a08-37be-4ab3-ae15-953533ab33b5\"> wiping as much as $87 billion off<\/a> the net worth of the country&#8217;s tech billionaires, including Pony Ma of Tencent and Colin Huang of Pinduoduo, according to Financial Times. The government wants <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/31\/china-roundup-keep-down-internet-upstarts-cultivate-hard-tech\/\">&#8220;hard tech&#8221; like semiconductors and clean energy<\/a>, so it has made it clear to future entrepreneurs where they should allocate their energy.

The Apple Card case is a strong example of how current anti-discrimination laws fall short of the fast pace of scientific research in the emerging field of quantifiable fairness.<\/p>\n<p>While it may be true that Apple and their underwriters were found innocent of fair lending violations, the ruling came with clear caveats that should be a warning sign to enterprises using machine learning within any regulated space. Unless executives begin to take algorithmic fairness <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/internet\/2021\/06\/16\/experts-doubt-ethical-ai-design-will-be-broadly-adopted-as-the-norm-within-the-next-decade\/\">more seriously<\/a>, their days ahead will be full of legal challenges and reputational damage.<\/p>\n<h2>What happened with Apple Card?<\/h2>\n<p>In late 2019, startup leader and social media celebrity David Heinemeier Hansson raised an important issue on <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dhh\/status\/1192540900393705474?lang=en\">Twitter<\/a>, to much fanfare and applause. With almost 50,000 likes and retweets, he asked Apple and their underwriting partner, Goldman Sachs, to explain why he and his wife, who share the same financial ability, would be granted different credit limits. To many in the field of algorithmic fairness, it was a watershed moment to see the issues we advocate go mainstream, culminating in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/11\/10\/business\/Apple-credit-card-investigation.html\">an inquiry<\/a> from the NY Department of Financial Services (DFS).<\/p>\n<p>At first glance, it may seem heartening to credit underwriters that the DFS concluded in March that Goldman\u2019s underwriting algorithm did not violate the strict rules of financial access created <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Equal_Credit_Opportunity_Act\">in 1974<\/a> to protect women and minorities from lending discrimination. While disappointing to activists, this result was not surprising to those of us working closely with data teams in finance.<\/p>\n<p>There are some algorithmic applications for financial institutions where the risks of experimentation far outweigh any benefit, and credit underwriting is one of them. We could have predicted that Goldman would be found innocent, because the laws for fairness in lending (if outdated) are clear and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/10\/07\/business\/citigroup-fine-risk-management.html\">strictly enforced<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, there is no doubt in my mind that the Goldman\/Apple algorithm discriminates, along with every other credit scoring and underwriting algorithm on the market today. Nor do I doubt that these algorithms would fall apart if researchers were ever granted access to the models and data we would need to validate this claim. I know this because the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dfs.ny.gov\/system\/files\/documents\/2021\/03\/rpt_202103_apple_card_investigation.pdf\">NY DFS partially released<\/a> its methodology for vetting the Goldman algorithm, and as you might expect, their audit fell far short of the standards held by modern algorithm auditors today.<\/p>\n<h2>How did DFS (under current law) assess the fairness of Apple Card?<\/h2>\n<p>In order to prove the Apple algorithm was &#8220;fair,&#8221; DFS considered first whether Goldman had used &#8220;prohibited characteristics&#8221; of potential applicants like gender or marital status. This one was easy for Goldman to pass \u2014 they don\u2019t include race, gender or marital status as an input to the model. However, we\u2019ve known for years now that some model features can act as <a href=\"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/GMA\/story?id=2623263&amp;page=1\">&#8220;proxies&#8221;<\/a> for protected classes.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tIf you\u2019re Black, a woman and pregnant, for instance, your likelihood of obtaining credit may be lower than the average of the outcomes among each overarching protected category.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>The DFS methodology, based on 50 years of legal precedent, failed to mention whether they considered this question, but we can guess that they did not. Because if they had, they\u2019d have quickly found that <a href=\"https:\/\/shiftprocessing.com\/credit-score\/#race\">credit score<\/a> is so tightly correlated to race that some states are considering banning its use for <a href=\"https:\/\/news.bloomberglaw.com\/insurance\/credit-based-insurance-premiums-raise-concerns-about-racial-bias\">casualty insurance<\/a>. Proxy features have only stepped into the research spotlight recently, giving us our first example of how science has outpaced regulation.<\/p>\n<p>In the absence of protected features, DFS then looked for credit profiles that were similar in content but belonged to people of different protected classes. In a certain imprecise sense, they sought to find out what would happen to the credit decision were we to \u201cflip\u201d the gender on the application. Would a female version of the male applicant receive the same treatment?<\/p>\n<p>Intuitively, this seems like one way to define &#8220;fair.&#8221; And it is \u2014 in the field of machine learning fairness, there is a concept called a <a href=\"https:\/\/dl.acm.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1145\/3351095.3372845\">&#8220;flip test&#8221;<\/a> and it is one of many measures of a concept called <a href=\"https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3819799\">&#8220;individual fairness,&#8221;<\/a> which is exactly what it sounds like. I asked Patrick Hall, principal scientist at bnh.ai, a leading boutique AI law firm, about the analysis most common in investigating fair lending cases. Referring to the methods DFS used to audit Apple Card, he called it basic regression, or &#8220;a 1970s version of the flip test,&#8221; bringing us example number two of our insufficient laws.<\/p>\n<h2>A new vocabulary for algorithmic fairness<\/h2>\n<p>Ever since Solon Barocas\u2019 seminal paper <a href=\"http:\/\/www.californialawreview.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/2Barocas-Selbst.pdf\">&#8220;Big Data\u2019s Disparate Impact&#8221;<\/a> in 2016, researchers have been hard at work to define core philosophical concepts into mathematical terms. <a href=\"https:\/\/facctconference.org\/\">Several conferences<\/a> have sprung into existence, with new fairness tracks emerging at the most notable AI events. The field is in a period of <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.einstein.ai\/ethics-in-ai-research-papers-and-articles\/\">hypergrowth<\/a>, where the law has as of yet failed to keep pace. But just like what happened to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/tech\/security\/colonial-hack-dhs-issues-first-cybersecurity-regulation-pipelines-rcna1050\">cybersecurity industry<\/a>, this legal reprieve won\u2019t last forever.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps we can forgive DFS for its softball audit given that the laws governing fair lending are born of the civil rights movement and have not evolved much in the 50-plus years since inception. The legal precedents were set long before machine learning fairness research really took off. If DFS had been appropriately equipped to deal with the challenge of evaluating the fairness of the Apple Card, they would have used the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/frai.2021.695301\/full\">robust vocabulary<\/a> for algorithmic assessment that\u2019s blossomed over the last five years.<\/p>\n<p>The DFS report, for instance, makes no mention of measuring &#8220;equalized odds,&#8221; a notorious line of inquiry first made famous in 2018 by Joy Buolamwini, Timnit Gebru and Deb Raji. Their <a href=\"http:\/\/gendershades.org\/\">\u201cGender Shades\u201d<\/a> paper proved that facial recognition algorithms guess wrong on dark female faces more often than they do on subjects with lighter skin, and this reasoning holds true for many applications of prediction beyond computer vision alone.<\/p>\n<p>Equalized odds would ask of Apple\u2019s algorithm: Just how often does it predict creditworthiness correctly? How often does it guess wrong? Are there disparities in these error rates among people of different genders, races or disability status? According to Hall, these measurements are important, but simply too new to have been fully codified into the legal system.<\/p>\n<p>If it turns out that Goldman regularly underestimates female applicants in the real world, or assigns interest rates that are higher than Black applicants truly deserve, it\u2019s easy to see how this would harm these underserved populations at national scale.<\/p>\n<h2>Financial services\u2019 Catch-22<\/h2>\n<p>Modern auditors know that the methods dictated by legal precedent fail to catch nuances in fairness for intersectional combinations within minority categories \u2014 a problem that\u2019s exacerbated by the complexity of machine learning models. If you\u2019re Black, a woman and pregnant, for instance, your likelihood of obtaining credit may be lower than the average of the outcomes among each overarching protected category.<\/p>\n<p>These underrepresented groups may never benefit from a holistic audit of the system without special attention paid to their uniqueness, given that the sample size of minorities is by definition a smaller number in the set. This is why modern auditors prefer <a href=\"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1104.3913.pdf\">&#8220;fairness through awareness&#8221;<\/a> approaches that allow us to measure results with explicit knowledge of the demographics of the individuals in each group.<\/p>\n<p>But there\u2019s a Catch-22. In financial services and other highly regulated fields, auditors often can\u2019t use &#8220;fairness through awareness,&#8221; because they may be prevented from collecting sensitive information from the start. The goal of this legal constraint was to prevent lenders from discrimination. In a cruel twist of fate, this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/the-apple-card-didnt-see-genderand-thats-the-problem\/?utm_source=WIR_REG_GATE\">gives cover<\/a> to algorithmic discrimination, giving us our third example of legal insufficiency.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qgR3CXFs5R\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/09\/how-twilio-is-moving-beyond-a-diversity-numbers-game-toward-becoming-an-antiracist-company\/\">How Twilio is moving beyond a diversity numbers game toward becoming an anti-racist company<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How Twilio is moving beyond a diversity numbers game toward becoming an anti-racist company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/09\/how-twilio-is-moving-beyond-a-diversity-numbers-game-toward-becoming-an-antiracist-company\/embed\/#?secret=qgR3CXFs5R\" data-secret=\"qgR3CXFs5R\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The fact that we can\u2019t collect this information hamstrings our ability to find out how models treat underserved groups. Without it, we might never prove what we know to be true in practice \u2014 full-time moms, for instance, will reliably have thinner credit files, because they don\u2019t execute every credit-based purchase under both spousal names. Minority groups may be far more likely to be gig workers, tipped employees or participate in cash-based industries, leading to commonalities among their income profiles that prove less common for the majority.<\/p>\n<p>Importantly, these differences on the applicants\u2019 credit files do not necessarily translate to true financial responsibility or creditworthiness. If it\u2019s your goal to predict creditworthiness accurately, you\u2019d want to know where the method (e.g., a credit score) breaks down.<\/p>\n<h2>What this means for businesses using AI<\/h2>\n<p>In Apple\u2019s example, it\u2019s worth mentioning a hopeful epilogue to the story where Apple made a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/20\/apple-announces-apple-card-family-for-spouses-to-build-credit-together-and-over-13s-to-use-it-too\/\">consequential update<\/a> to their credit policy to combat the discrimination that is protected by our antiquated laws. In Apple CEO Tim Cook\u2019s announcement, he was quick to highlight a &#8220;lack of fairness in the way the industry [calculates] credit scores.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Their new policy allows spouses or parents to combine credit files such that the weaker credit file can benefit from the stronger. It\u2019s a great example of a company thinking ahead to steps that may actually reduce the discrimination that exists structurally in our world. In updating their policies, Apple got ahead of the regulation that may come as a result of this inquiry.<\/p>\n<p>This is a strategic advantage for Apple, because NY DFS made <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dfs.ny.gov\/reports_and_publications\/press_releases\/pr202103231\">exhaustive mention<\/a> of the insufficiency of current laws governing this space, meaning updates to regulation may be nearer than many think. To quote Superintendent of Financial Services Linda A. Lacewell: &#8220;The use of credit scoring in its current form and laws and regulations barring discrimination in lending are in need of strengthening and modernization.&#8221; In my own experience working with regulators, this is something today\u2019s authorities are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.occ.gov\/news-issuances\/news-releases\/2021\/nr-ia-2021-39.html\">very keen<\/a> to explore.<\/p>\n<p>I have no doubt that American regulators are working to improve the laws that govern AI, taking advantage of this robust vocabulary for equality in automation and math. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/newsevents\/speech\/brainard20210112a.htm\">Federal Reserve<\/a>, OCC, CFPB, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.natlawreview.com\/article\/ftc-issues-new-guidance-warning-bias-artificial-intelligence-could-create-potential\">FTC<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.markey.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/senator-markey-rep-matsui-introduce-legislation-to-combat-harmful-algorithms-and-create-new-online-transparency-regime\">Congress<\/a> are all eager to address algorithmic discrimination, even if their pace is slow.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, we have every reason to believe that algorithmic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.partnershiponai.org\/aiincidentdatabase\/\">discrimination is rampant<\/a>, largely because the industry has also been slow to adopt the language of academia that the last few years have brought. Little excuse remains for enterprises failing to take advantage of this new field of fairness, and to root out the predictive discrimination that is in some ways guaranteed. And the EU <a href=\"https:\/\/digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu\/en\/news\/europe-fit-digital-age-commission-proposes-new-rules-and-actions-excellence-and-trust-artificial\">agrees<\/a>, with draft laws that apply specifically to AI that are set to be adopted some time in the next two years.<\/p>\n<p>The field of machine learning fairness has matured quickly, with new techniques discovered every year and myriad <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/09\/arthur-ai-snags-15m-series-a-to-grow-machine-learning-monitoring-tool\/\">tools<\/a> to help. The field is only now reaching a point where this can be prescribed with some degree of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getparity.ai\/\">automation<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.responsible.ai\/\">Standards bodies<\/a> have stepped in to provide guidance to lower the frequency and severity of these issues, even if American law is slow to adopt.<\/p>\n<p>Because whether discrimination by algorithm is intentional, it is illegal. So, anyone using advanced analytics for applications relating to healthcare, housing, hiring, financial services, education or government are likely breaking these laws without knowing it.<\/p>\n<p>Until clearer regulatory guidance becomes available for the myriad applications of AI in sensitive situations, the industry is on its own to figure out which definitions of fairness are best.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"VibDE7bMeJ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/03\/embodied-ai-superintelligence-and-the-master-algorithm\/\">Embodied AI, superintelligence and the master algorithm<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Embodied AI, superintelligence and the master algorithm&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/03\/embodied-ai-superintelligence-and-the-master-algorithm\/embed\/#?secret=VibDE7bMeJ\" data-secret=\"VibDE7bMeJ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Apple Card case is a strong example of how current anti-discrimination laws fall short of the fast pace of scientific research in the emerging field of quantifiable fairness.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574447,"featured_media":2189702,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"5162fda3-032f-3913-b898-409845540180"},"categories":[424613844,25515,35027640,352,576597428],"tags":[449554570,291,576645466,12374,420628854,35719817,449557039,576602344,113093,1024626,53015,216504,40978,576869354],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/GettyImages-1175965941.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3yLUrdS","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","editorialContentProvider":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[2027926],"hide_featured_image":false,"canonical_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/14\/how-the-law-got-it-wrong-with-apple-card\/","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2189615"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2189615"}],"version-history":[{"count":8,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2189615\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2189736,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2189615\/revisions\/2189736"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/liz-osullivan"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2189615&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574447"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2189702"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2189615"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2189615"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2189615"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2189615"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2189615"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2189615"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2189615"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":2027926,"name":"Liz O'Sullivan","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/liz-osullivan\/","description":"Liz O\u2019Sullivan is CEO of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.getparity.ai\/\">Parity<\/a>, a platform that automates model risk and algorithmic governance for the enterprise.

company that customers would be upset to separate from their identity,\u201d growth marketing expert Julian Shapiro told us earlier this week. \u201cFor example, they\u2019d cease to be the man with Slack stickers all over his laptop. Or the woman who no longer wears Nike shoes every day. And that bugs them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Shapiro comes from a technical background, as a repeat startup founder and open-source web developer. But these days, as the co-founder of growth education company Demand Curve and startup growth agency Bell Curve, he advocates telling your story by speaking from the heart. We interviewed him earlier this week to hear more about how he sees marketing in 2021.<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere on TechCrunch and Extra Crunch this week, we published guest columns about using influencers in early-stage brands, the global retail media spending trend and talked to Growth Folks, a growth marketing organization in India.<\/p>\n<p>But first, here are a couple of the most recent recommendations from founders in our startup growth marketer survey.

She\u2019s able to cut through the jargon\/vanity metrics and has found a way to consistently and reliably engineer growth for us. What\u2019s unique about Bili\u2019s approach is that her strategy moves beyond just marketing. She is data driven and takes an iterative experimental approach to unlocking growth across various business pillars, from marketing to product and operations.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Marketer:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/jackabramowitz.com\/\">Jack Abramowitz<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Recommended by:<\/strong> Marwen Refaat, <a href=\"https:\/\/gamefi.com\">GameFi<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Testimonial:<\/strong> &#8220;Jack is incredibly talented at both growth hacking as well as building an automated growth engine.

Now, I see many startups going out of the box and putting in efforts to find new ways of acquisition. They haven\u2019t restricted them to acquiring users via the traditional ways and that\u2019s why you see so many ideas going viral so easily.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/09\/early-stage-brands-should-also-unlock-the-power-of-influencers\/?tpcc=ECTW2020\">(Extra Crunch) Early-stage brands should also unlock the power of influencers:<\/a> Jonathan Martinez, an experienced growth marketer, breaks down influencer marketing.

We made it to Friday, everyone. Congratulations! Despite it being the end of the week, we still have lots to talk about. Reddit taking on TikTok. Valuation changes in a key startup sector. And what it may really mean for a workplace to be apolitical. So read on, friends &#8212; there\u2019s a lot to talk about! &#8212; <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/alex\">Alex<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/13\/reddit-is-quietly-rolling-out-a-tiktok-like-video-feed-button-on-ios\/\"><strong>Reddit takes on TikTok:<\/strong><\/a><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Recently TikTok announced that it was going to shake up its controls to make its service <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/12\/tiktok-to-add-more-privacy-protections-for-teenaged-users-limit-push-notifications\/\">a bit less addictive<\/a>. While the social video service works on itself, other companies want to challenge its huge market presence. Reddit is joining YouTube, Snap and others in the war. I wonder where Reddit\u2019s product domain will reach by the time it\u2019s done expanding its feature set.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/13\/what-happens-when-wall-street-falls-out-of-love-with-your-sector\/\"><strong>Privately loved, publicly panned:<\/strong><\/a><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>The cohort of insurtech companies that went public in the last year were riding high while private.

And <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/06\/a-lot-of-cash-and-little-love-an-insurtech-story\/\">fall some more<\/a>.

The Argentine company builds personal financial products, and its new round and resulting multi-unicorn valuation helps underscore just how global the fintech revolution is proving to be.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/13\/orchata-raises-4m-aims-to-build-a-gopuff-for-latin-america\/\"><strong>Gopuff, but for Latin America:<\/strong><\/a><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Sticking to the region, Orchata just put together $4 million in new capital. The company wants to replicate the magic that Gopuff has managed to conjure, but farther south of where the U.S. company operates. Given how amply SoftBank has backed Gopuff, we\u2019re counting down until the second Vision Fund arrives to pour cash into the hands of the Y Combinator-backed startup.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/13\/kiddom-series-c\/\"><strong>Rapid ARR growth helps Kiddom raise more funds:<\/strong><\/a><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Kiddom, a \u201cplatform that offers a digital curriculum that fits the core standards required by states,\u201d per our own reporting, is growing like a weed. Natasha reports that Kiddom\u2019s ARR scaled 300% from 2020 to 2021. That pace of revenue accretion helped the company secure a $35 million Series C.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/13\/employee-talent-predictor-retrain-ai-raised-another-7m-adds-splunk-as-strategic-investor\/\"><strong>Reskilling could be big:<\/strong><\/a><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Investors just put $7 million into Retrain.ai, a startup that wants to use AI and ML to \u201chelp governments and organizations retrain and upskill talent for jobs of the future, enable diversity initiatives, and help employees and jobseekers manage their careers.\u201d All that sounds rather good. Especially as I keep reading about blogging robots that are set to take my job away.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/12\/yc-backed-tablevibes-customer-surveys-help-restaurants-reduce-their-reliance-on-delivery-apps\/\"><strong>Tablevibe wants to limit what restaurants pay delivery apps:<\/strong><\/a><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>The food game is a hard one. Margins are low. Customers are whiny. And lately staffing has been an issue. Tablevibe is helping with one particular vector of restaurant pain, namely how much food venues pay the likes of DoorDash and Uber Eats to get their product to customers. Anything to help the small business world makes us sit up and take notice. The company was part of the current Y Combinator batch, notably, so we should hear more from them at demo day.<\/li>\n<li>If you need <em>more<\/em> startup news, Equity\u2019s roundup from the week is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/13\/dont-give-your-weed-dealer-all-your-data\/\">here<\/a>.

Said Brent Leary of CRM Essentials:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A customer could sponsor a show, advertise a show or possibly collaborate on a show. And have leads generated from the show [which could be] directly tied to the activity from those options and track ROI. And it\u2019s all done on one platform.

Look, regulation is fine, but trying to abuse companies and harass their staff for political reasons sucks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>TechCrunch Experts: Growth Marketing<\/h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2159841\" style=\"width: 1510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2159841\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2159841 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/GettyImages-1009465486.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration montage based on education and knowledge in blue\" width=\"1500\" height=\"942\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/GettyImages-1009465486.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/GettyImages-1009465486.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/GettyImages-1009465486.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/GettyImages-1009465486.jpg?resize=768,482 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/GettyImages-1009465486.jpg?resize=680,427 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/GettyImages-1009465486.jpg?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2159841\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gettyimages.com\/search\/photographer?family=creative&amp;photographer=SEAN+GLADWELL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEAN GLADWELL <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a> \/ Getty Images<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch wants to help startups find the right expert for their needs.

To hear more about the growth behind the numbers we caught up with Ayush Srivastava, a co-founder of growth marketing group <a href=\"https:\/\/www.growthfolks.in\/\">Growth Folks<\/a> (and a growth marketer at Zynga by day).<\/p>\n<p>The organization, which describes itself as \u201cIndia\u2019s largest community of growth enthusiasts,\u201d began as in-person events for growth marketers across major cities, but made the jump to online networking during the pandemic. From there it began an online speaker series for its 1,300-some members, introduced more community networking groups and virtual events, and one-on-one mentoring.<\/p>\n<p>In the interview below, part of our ongoing series profiling growth marketers around the world, he says India&#8217;s startup scene has quickly gotten more sophisticated about growth in recent years. Companies are centering high-quality user growth as a shared team goal, not as a side job, and are thinking more creatively about where and how to find users. &#8220;I am amazed at how the startups are focusing on tier two-three cities here in India. With the pace with which internet access has grown \u2026 they are making sure they are solving the problem faced by rural Indians as well. [I] just love the fact that proper solutions are being built in the right manner for the concerned pain point.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>You describe Growth Folks as \u201cIndia&#8217;s largest community of growth enthusiasts,\u201d with more than 1,300 members. What does \u201cgrowth enthusiast\u201d mean to you, and how does that term define you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The terms &#8220;growth&#8221; and &#8220;growth marketing&#8221; have picked up a lot in the last five years in the Indian startup ecosystem. All of a sudden there are more than a million heads who are interested to be a part of this circle or are already a part of this community. This had a positive impact as more and more people started to look at their growth problems and not only just promoting their business. For us, growth enthusiasts are everyone and anyone who is even one percent excited about how to grow a particular brand\/service.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did the focus and efforts of Growth Folks change during the pandemic for community engagement?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the pre-COVID era, Growth Folks was heavily functional in the offline space. We used to manage and engage the community online but most of the efforts went in and success used to come from the offline activities that we used to organize. From December 2018 through the end of 2019, we organized more than 80+ offline events in nine cities of India. These events were previously panel discussions, industry talks or seminars followed by networking sessions.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>[H]owever, once COVID came into the picture, our operations shifted completely online and I must say the shift was quite smooth but exciting for me. We started hosting biweekly online webinars with industry leaders and tried giving our community folks (and new attendees) a look and feel of the physical event in the form of this virtual gathering so that they feel connected.<\/p>\n<p>Ever since lockdown began, we have done over 25+ events and have had speakers from companies like SEMRush, Baremetrics, Zynga, Indigo Airlines, Adjust, Myntra and many more. Not only this, we started a lot of interesting threads on our Facebook group to get people to engage more. Within the same period, we launched our website to give people an idea about all our services.<\/p>\n<p>We made sure that we are having dedicated networking sessions after the webinars for people to interact with each other. In October 2020, we relaunched the online version of \u201cBrunch Sessions\u201d that we used to have in the pre-COVID times. These brunch sessions helped the fellow community people to come together on a single day and interact and chill with each other virtually. We started producing more online content knowing the fact that this could be a way to have a value add and it worked.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. <\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href=\"https:\/\/oathtechevents.typeform.com\/to\/bwwIWF03\">this quick survey<\/a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Growth Folks is multifaceted, offering traditional growth marketing services as well as hosting a \u201cgrowth hackathon\u201d and community activities. What can a startup expect when working with Growth Folks? How is it different from existing services?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have been virtually able to connect with so many people and we continue to do so \u2026 [W]e started something which is called \u201cgrowth huddle.\u201d It is a highly curated one-on-one mentorship session with a few of the best talents out there in the growth space. You can book your session and we will take you through the entire process to make sure that the session is right on point and you learn what you want, not what we want.<\/p>\n<p>All of the mentors who were onboarded vary from experience level to expertise and provide the right set of guidance needed for individuals and startups to grow further. We also partnered with startups and companies for various online events to promote them and make sure that the right voice reaches out to the right set of people who matter to them \u2014 the Growth Folks. We have collaborated with companies like Adjust, Microsoft, Rocketium, Canva and many more and we have been able to make people learn the right things.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are startups doing better now than ever before? In India? Around the world?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Companies have started realizing the true importance of having a fully functional growth team and they have started acknowledging their one metric that matters as well. The growth marketers have also started setting up a lot of experiments and have taken a data-driven approach to solving a problem. Now, I see many startups going out of the box and putting in efforts to find new ways of acquisition. They haven\u2019t restricted them to acquiring users via the traditional ways and that\u2019s why you see so many ideas going viral so easily. And all in different ways.<\/p>\n<p>I see so many founders not restricting themselves to hiring just a growth marketer for leading all growth initiatives. Rather, they have spent time understanding the importance of it and have ended up building a full force growth team of marketers, PMs, tech people, designers, etc. I feel that is the best way to look at any growth problem statement.<\/p>\n<p>I am amazed at how the startups are focusing on tier two-three cities here in India. With the pace with which internet access has grown \u2026 they are making sure they are solving the problem faced by rural Indians as well. [I] just love the fact that proper solutions are being built in the right manner for the concerned pain point.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, companies have started considering the importance of the entire customer experience more seriously than ever before. This is helping brands to grow via communities easily and create a strong brand presence.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"

Today, the streaming speaker company scored an early victory with the U.S. International Trade Commission. A preliminary ruling penned by ITC chief administrative law judge Charles Bullock finds that Google infringed on five patents.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cToday the ALJ has found all five of Sonos\u2019 asserted patents to be valid and that Google infringes on all five patents,\u201d Sonos Chief Legal Officer Eddie Lazarus said in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cWe are pleased the ITC has confirmed Google\u2019s blatant infringement of Sonos\u2019 patented inventions. This decision re-affirms the strength and breadth of our portfolio, marking a promising milestone in our long-term pursuit to defend our innovation against misappropriation by Big Tech monopolies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The finding is still very much early days for what\u2019s likely to be an even more protracted battled battle between the two companies. Sonos\u2019 complaint stems from Google\u2019s own family of streaming speakers. Google entered the category, long dominated by Sonos, roughly four and a half years ago with the original Home speaker. The line now includes a number of products now listed under the Nest banner.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGoogle has been blatantly and knowingly copying our patented technology,\u201d Sonos CEO Patrick Spence said in a statement when the suit was initially filed. \u201cDespite our repeated and extensive efforts over the last few years, Google has not shown any willingness to work with us on a mutually beneficial solution. We\u2019re left with no choice but to litigate.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sonos noted similar issues with Amazon devices (Google\u2019s chief competitor in the category) at the time, but the company opted to focus its time, money and resources on a battle with Google, instead.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, Sonos is hoping to use the ITC to block the import of those smart speakers, along with other Google hardware, including the Chromecast and Pixels. Such a decision would be a massive hit to Google\u2019s hardware ambitions.

web redesign isn&#8217;t as accessible as it should be, experts say"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">After teasing its new font in January, Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/11\/twitter-redesigns-website-with-new-font-less-clutter-and-high-contrast-features\/\">made some major changes<\/a> to its website and app design this week. But while Twitter framed these updates as making the platform \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/twitterdesign\/status\/1425505308563099650?s=21\">more accessible<\/a>,\u201d some accessibility experts say that these changes missed the mark.<\/p>\n<p>Most noticeably, tweets now appear in \u201cChirp,\u201d Twitter\u2019s proprietary typeface, and the display has even more visual contrast between the background and text. Other updates made the interface less cluttered, removing unnecessary divider lines. For people with low vision, high-contrast design can make websites more legible, but the current contrast level is so high that it\u2019s causing strain for some users. Twitter far exceeds the minimum contrast standards set by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/standards-guidelines\/wcag\/\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines<\/a> (WCAG), which provides recommendations for making websites accessible to disabled people. But web accessibility isn\u2019t one-size fits all &#8212; while some users may need a high-contrast display, others who suffer from chronic migraines might require a more muted experience. Research has also shown that dyslexic people <a href=\"https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/RD\/2012\/text-customization\/r11\">tend to read faster<\/a> when presented with lower-contrast text.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"lV9qXwL3tX\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/11\/twitter-redesigns-website-with-new-font-less-clutter-and-high-contrast-features\/\">Twitter redesigns website and app with new font, less clutter and high-contrast features<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Twitter redesigns website and app with new font, less clutter and high-contrast features&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/11\/twitter-redesigns-website-with-new-font-less-clutter-and-high-contrast-features\/embed\/#?secret=lV9qXwL3tX\" data-secret=\"lV9qXwL3tX\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>\u201cWhen the update hit, I could immediately feel pain in my eyes, and within about half an hour, I was having a tension headache,\u201d said Alex Haagaard, a design researcher and founding member at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.disabledlist.org\/\">The Disabled List<\/a>. \u201cI have a lot of chronic pain, and I cannot deliberately expose myself to something that is going to be exacerbating my levels of pain, because then that has cascade effects.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Up until last year, Twitter\u2019s accessibility team was volunteer-based &#8212; paid employees at Twitter would take on accessibility projects on top of their existing jobs, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/18\/somehow-twitter-does-not-have-a-team-dedicated-to-accessibility\/\">TechCrunch reported<\/a>. In September, a few months after Twitter had released an <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TwitterSupport\/status\/1273794890543935488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1273794890543935488%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Ftwitters-voice-tweets-upset-users-again-over-accessibility-11593612001\">audio tweet feature<\/a> without accessibility considerations, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/en_us\/topics\/company\/2020\/making-twitter-more-accessible\">Twitter introduced<\/a> two dedicated accessibility teams within its company. But experts emphasize that including disabled people in design decisions from the get-go is necessary when implementing new features.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey talked a good talk about how they were going to change this, that they were going to integrate accessibility and disabled perspectives more into their design processes, and from this, it seems they have not done an adequate job with that,\u201d said Haagaard. \u201cEngaging people from disabled communities as consultants at the high-level stages, within the research and conceptualization phase, would prevent designers from getting to a point where you\u2019re testing something and you realize it\u2019s fundamentally problematic and it\u2019s too late.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Twitter told TechCrunch that &#8220;feedback was sought from people with disabilities throughout the process, from the beginning.

This afternoon, the platform added that due to user feedback, it is making contrast changes on all buttons to make them &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TwitterA11y\/status\/1426260504687824905\">easier on the eyes<\/a>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen a design organization makes an announcement, and the accessibility organization alongside it actually has things to say about it, that means they work together, and that\u2019s always a good thing,\u201d said Matt May, head of Inclusive Design at Adobe. \u201cThe key thing is to continue to listen and find the people who aren\u2019t being represented, and try to synthesize them within the rest of the system.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"c-message_kit__gutter\">\n<div class=\"c-message_kit__gutter__right\" data-qa=\"message_content\">\n<div class=\"c-message_kit__blocks c-message_kit__blocks--rich_text\">\n<div class=\"c-message__message_blocks c-message__message_blocks--rich_text\">\n<div class=\"p-block_kit_renderer\" data-qa=\"block-kit-renderer\">\n<div class=\"p-block_kit_renderer__block_wrapper p-block_kit_renderer__block_wrapper--first\">\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_block\" dir=\"auto\">\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">May points out that an update this ostentatious will inevitably yield more pushback, but behind the scenes, the app is, he said, \u201cdoing important accessibility work that usually slides under the radar.\u201d For example, <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Twitter recently enabled users to <\/span><a style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/merylkevans\/status\/1425955489490350084\">upload SRT files<\/a> to videos, which adds captions.<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> Plus, Twitter Spaces has support for <\/span><a style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/27\/twitter-spaces-will-be-available-for-web-including-accessibility-features\/\">live captioning<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">, while competitors like Clubhouse still don\u2019t offer this basic accessibility feature.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s odd that Twitter neglected to add customization capabilities when it rolled out its higher-contrast display and new default typeface, since the company has a history of offering customization elsewhere in its user experience. Currently, users can toggle among dark, light and dim modes, make their default font size bigger or smaller, and even change the look of buttons and hyperlinks to colors like purple, orange and pink. Even before this week\u2019s update, Twitter\u2019s accessibility panel allowed users to enable a higher contrast mode. But still, there is no way for users to reduce the contrast or change what font the site uses, which experts cite as a design flaw. With its first proprietary typeface Chirp, Twitter sought to \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DerritDeRouen\/status\/1354548649561186306\">improve how we convey emotion<\/a>,\u201d but users reported the font to be more difficult to read than Helvetica, which Twitter used before Chirp.<\/p>\n<p>According to Shawn Lawton Henry &#8212; a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, editor of the WCAG recommendations, and leader of the World Wide Web Consortium\u2019s accessibility education and outreach &#8212; websites should include customization options for users to toggle among fonts, contrast levels and more. WCAG doesn\u2019t require this currently, but Henry says that future updates of the guidelines will recommend that websites give users the option to change contrast.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe main issue is that the default contrast should [meet the WCAG standards] and users should be able to change it. It\u2019s not hard, right?\u201d Henry said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine to have a default font, but you have to make it customizable. Even if it was the most readable font known, it would still be important to allow people to change it because of individual differences.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When asked about adding ways for users to change typefaces and contrast levels, a Twitter spokesperson said that the company had \u201cno concrete plans to share right now, but we&#8217;re always looking at ways to improve the experience and listening to feedback.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think part of the disappointment here is that they&#8217;re framing this as an accessibility thing, but it&#8217;s also really clear that it was equally about building brand identity,&#8221; Haagaard said.<\/p>\n<p>While some users will override website settings with USS (User Style Sheets), Henry\u2019s research for the World Wide Web Consortium showed that user agents like web browsers and e-book readers should provide users the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/RD\/2012\/text-customization\/r14\">ability to customize<\/a> these settings more easily. Not all users are tech-savvy enough to write USS, and it\u2019s easier for users to toggle among the accessibility settings specific to an app.\u00a0This level of customization isn\u2019t unprecedented &#8212; in June, Discord added <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/discord\/status\/1405979713525272576?lang=en\">a saturation slider<\/a> in its accessibility settings, for example.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe beauty of the web is that it\u2019s not paper, and we can change it,\u201d Henry said.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"KhIDFCLbN6\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/27\/how-to-make-sure-that-your-product-is-accessible-to-all-users\/\">How to make sure that your product is accessible to all users<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How to make sure that your product is accessible to all users&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/27\/how-to-make-sure-that-your-product-is-accessible-to-all-users\/embed\/#?secret=KhIDFCLbN6\" data-secret=\"KhIDFCLbN6\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After teasing its new font in January, Twitter made some major changes to its website and app design this week.

says it just used its own product to establish a new &#8212; and far higher &#8212; valuation for itself"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.carta.com\/\">Carta<\/a>, the nine-year-old, San Francisco-based cap table management and valuation software company, just raised $500 million in its eighth round of funding, at a $7.4 billion valuation. That&#8217;s more than double where the company was valued eight months ago when it closed its seventh round of funding at a valuation of $3.1 billion.<\/p>\n<p>With so much money flooding into privately held companies, giant leaps in valuation are no longer all that notable. What&#8217;s different about this particular story is how Carta&#8217;s new valuation was established, which it says was to run an auction using its own trading platform to sell $100 million of its shares to secondary buyers, then use the valuation at which the shares sold &#8212; $6.9 billion &#8212; as evidence to primary investors of Carta&#8217;s true value.<\/p>\n<p>For a company that&#8217;s trying to raise awareness of its trading platform &#8212; Carta wants to sell more of the secondary shares of other companies, too &#8212; it was a smart marketing play. It was Carta eating its own dog food, in the somewhat repellant parlance of the startup world. Still, it&#8217;s unclear whether we&#8217;re likely to see it replicated by other companies going forward.<\/p>\n<p>First, what Carta did is &#8212; we think &#8212; unprecedented in establishing a price for secondary shares. Typically, a small group comes together and negotiates a price or, if it&#8217;s 20 or more sellers who are willing to offload shares to buyers, it&#8217;s considered a &#8220;tender offer&#8221; and involves a prospectus-type document, including financial statements, risk factors and all that other jazz, which is sent to an established group of potential buyers.<\/p>\n<p>In Carta&#8217;s case, as Carta CEO Henry Ward suggests in a <a href=\"https:\/\/henrysward.medium.com\/carta-series-g-3a3702f69b11\">new Medium post<\/a>, by running an auction process, many more investors participated in the price discovery of its shares than might have been possible otherwise. (A <a href=\"https:\/\/henrysward.medium.com\/finally-a-private-stock-exchange-cartax-3c658f30ac97\">prior post<\/a> by Ward says that 414 participants participated in 1,484 executed orders.)<\/p>\n<p>The endeavor makes a lot of sense, says longtime startup attorney Tim Harris of Morrison &amp; Foerster, who was not involved in the process but is a student of market efficiencies. &#8220;Ward is basically saying, &#8216;We&#8217;re using a broader market price-seeking process instead of what he describes as one-off. You see it in real estate listings all the time,&#8221; adds Harris. &#8220;There&#8217;s no reason companies can&#8217;t do the same.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The question that startup founders may be wondering right now is whether an auction process like Carta&#8217;s can truly help establish a price for primary shares. Naturally, Ward says it can. In his Medium post, he argues that the auction very much strengthened the case that Carta could make to investors, including Silver Lake, which ultimately led Carta&#8217;s newest $500 million round. (It was a Series G, and Carta has now raised $1.29 billion altogether, it tells us.)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>While we don&#8217;t doubt it was a useful data point, Silver Lake is a sophisticated investment firm that has been valuing companies for 21 years; likely, it would have arrived at the valuation it did without that earlier auction.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, there are other reasons to think an auction like Carta&#8217;s will remain an outlier.<\/p>\n<p>For his part, attorney Anthony McCusker, who co-chairs the tech practice at Goodwin Proctor, questions whether &#8220;companies are going to outsource their valuation discovery to Carta.&#8221; Most founders and CEOs would prefer to talk directly with investors when it comes to establishing the valuation of their company rather than leave it to the wisdom of crowds, he suggests.<\/p>\n<p>Markets can also &#8220;be gamed,&#8221; as notes Harris of MoFo, observing that the integrity of any platform &#8220;depends on oversight and the quality of bids on a platform,&#8221; (Harris half-kiddingly wonders what happened, for example, to the bidder who said he or she would pay <a href=\"https:\/\/people.com\/human-interest\/jeff-bezos-space-flight-auction-winning-bid-28-million-brother-mark\/\">$28 million<\/a> to join Jeff Bezos on his trip to space, then later cited &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theregister.com\/2021\/07\/16\/blue_origins_flight\/\">scheduling conflicts<\/a>.&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>As for us, we wonder how many founding teams are willing to open up the secondary sale of their shares to a potentially much wider circle of backers when historically, they have not. We also wonder whether, for some companies, that discovery process could backfire. Carta is a hot commodity, after all, but it&#8217;s easy to imagine scenarios in which companies&#8217; secondary shares aren&#8217;t worth to outsiders what founders think that they are.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the industry is changing so fast that little would surprise us at this point. Indeed, whatever happens, the auction is clearly part of a larger trend toward transparency that continues to play out in interesting new ways all the time.<\/p>\n<p>As Harris notes, when he began practicing law 26 year ago, &#8220;venture was a completely closed ecosystem.&#8221; Now, he says, &#8220;There&#8217;s a wealth of data being shared and disseminated to maker smarter business decisions.

Consider creating a bot to alert you of any product mentions on Twitter, or surface subject-matter discussions on Reddit (\u201cBest tools to manage AWS costs?\u201d or \u201cWhich marketplace do you resell your old electronics on?&#8221;), which you can then respond to with thoughtful commentary.<\/p>\n<p>Join relevant communities on Discord, infiltrate Slack groups of relevant conferences (including past iterations of a conference\u200a \u2014 \u200achances are those groups are still alive with activity), follow forums on StackOverflow and engage in the discussions on all these channels.<\/p>\n<p>The more often you post, the better your posts convert. The more your handle appears on newsfeeds, the more likely it will be included on widely quoted \u201clisticles.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My list of coolest startups around today:<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Replit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Replit<\/a> &#8211; no more dev environments<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/highlightrun?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@highlightrun<\/a> &#8211; understand how people use your app<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DoNotPayLaw?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DoNotPayLaw<\/a>  &#8211; saves \u23f3+\ud83d\udcb0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Superhuman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Superhuman<\/a> &#8211; first pleasant email app<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/railway_app?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Railway_App<\/a> &#8211; what Heroku should have been<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/pipe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@pipe<\/a> &#8211; recurring revenue = assets<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Zain Allarakhia (@zallarak) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/zallarak\/status\/1394683128069779457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 18, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>Most \u201cuser-generated content\u201d in the early innings should be generated by you, from both personal accounts and company accounts.<\/p>\n<h2>Build in public \u2026<\/h2>\n<p>Building in public is scary given the speed at which ideas can be copied, but competition will always exist, since new ideas are not born in vacuums.

beyond transactions and grow lasting customer relationships.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Nearly three in 10 employees<\/span> (29%) would quit their job if they were told they were no longer allowed to work remotely, according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.livecareer.com\/resources\/careers\/planning\/is-remote-work-here-to-stay\">recent survey.<\/a> In addition, a recent Harvard Business Study found that \u201ccompanies that let their workers decide where and when to do their jobs \u2014 whether in another city or in the middle of the night \u2014 increase employee productivity, reduce turnover and lower organizational costs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Over the past 18 months, while instituting a remote work model, our turnover rate at Insightly was the lowest in company history and an internal survey found happiness levels to be twice as high from the previous year. This in the midst of a major pandemic, social movement, forest fires and a disruptive election \u2014 all happening at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tAs long as your employees are available when your customers are in need and goals are consistently met, 9 to 5 no longer needs to be a thing.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>On a larger, global scale, employers from companies around the world are coming to the same realization: You don\u2019t need an office to be productive and employees are happier working from home.<\/p>\n<p>The next logical step is, at the same time, a majorly disruptive one and a 180-degree shift toward how companies have operated for over 100 years \u2014 the transition from in-person headquarters to a remote, work-from-anywhere model. In line with this shift, we\u2019ve foregone our 40,000-square-foot Soma office space and employees are able to work from anywhere in the United States while keeping the same salary.<\/p>\n<p>There will no doubt be challenges, and there already have been. But with these challenges also arises immense opportunity. Here are a few battle-tested tips on how to maintain productivity while delivering flexibility with this new work model:<\/p>\n<h2>Reallocate overhead savings<\/h2>\n<p>Let employees choose where they live. Allowing this option will better their lives and make for happy, engaged employees. Overhead costs, especially in large cities such as San Francisco, are the largest operating expense for most companies. Take this large sum of money and invest in employee happiness. You don\u2019t need thousands of square feet in office space to be successful.<\/p>\n<p>That massive overhead cost you just got rid of? Use this toward more meaningful employee experiences that will enhance their lives.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Employers are at crucial crossroads when it comes to deciding where and how to let employers do their jobs.
